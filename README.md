# README.MD

This repository contains a flattened version of the Bracknell Forest Council 
Website.

The website originally was built using a variety of tools including NPM, 
Yeoman, Grunt and hosted in a number of Docker containers. As this system was
woefully undocumented the decision was made to use a copy of the "built" site
with symlinks replaced by actual files (with the exception of the hash salt).

There is a file /docroot/sites/all/modules/custom/bracknell/bracknell_base/
includes/bracknell_base.helpers.inc that contains custom helper functions that
can be used throughout the site. See the README.MD inside the folder.
