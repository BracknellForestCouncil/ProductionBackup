#README.MD

This repository contains a flattened version of the Bracknell Forest Council 
Web-site.

The web-site originally was built using a variety of tools including NPM, 
Yeoman, Grunt and hosted in a number of Docker containers. As this system was
woefully undocumented the decision was made to use a copy of the "built" site
with sym-links replaced by actual files (with the exception of the hash salt).
